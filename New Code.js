    Light Binary Trees and Traversal Notes:        
        -Binary Trees all have a root, and each node has at most two children (left child and right child)
        -each child node of the root is less then the root node on the left, and greater on the right
        -breath traversal will visit nodes in the order of the level of the tree
        -depth traversal will visit nodes in the order of the depth of the tree
        -need to have sorted Data before using a binary tree to search

        Sorting:
            -Bubble Sort: O(n^2) time complexity, O(1) space complexity, 
            bubble sorting is going through a list and comparing each pair 
            and checking if one is greater than the other, if so, swap them, 
            if not, move on to the next pair
            
            -Insertion Sort: O(n^2) time complexity, O(1) space complexity,
            insertion sort is going through a list and comparing each element
            to the previous one, if the current element is smaller, move it to the
            front of the previous element, if not, move on to the next element
            
            -Selection Sort: O(n^2) time complexity, O(1) space complexity,
            selection sort is going through a list and finding the smallest element
            and moving it to the front of the list, then finding the next smallest
            element and moving it to the front of the list, and so on
            
            -Merge Sort: O(n log n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity,
            merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, it splits the list
            into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together
            
            -Quick Sort: O(n log n) time complexity, O(log n) space complexity,
            quick sort is also a divide and conquer algorithm, it picks a pivot
            and puts all the elements less than the pivot on the left and all the
            elements greater than the pivot on the right

            -Recursive Sort: O(n log n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity,
            recursive sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, it splits the list
            into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together

    more sorting notes:
        -Worked on bubble sorting today, used 2 for loops but realized that if i just use one for loop 
        and compare each pair of elements, it would be more efficient
        -Would have to add a swapped variable and check each iteration to see if anything was swapped,
        and if nothing is then you can break out, but that would add more complexity

    After thanksgiving break:
        -First day back after thanksgiving break, did some work with html and css but nothing to crazy
        -Also worked on a project that involved using a binary search tree, and traversing it in different ways
        -Bubbble sort is ineficient, but it is simple to implement, and it is good for small lists

    Graphs:
        -Worked on graphing, learned about different types of graphs, such as directed and undirected
        -Also learned about bidirectional and undirected edges
        -Graph traversal is a big part of graphing, and there are different types of traversal,
        such as depth first and breadth first.

    Graph Complexity:
        -Graph complexity is a measure of how difficult it is to traverse a graph
        -There are different types of graph complexity, such as linear, quadratic, and exponential

    HTML/CSS:
        -Started the new html coding module, learned about different types of tags and how to use them
        -Nothing crazy right away, but it's good to get a feel for how html and css work together

    HTML/CSS Day Two:
        -Playing around with more html content, and css styling
        -Classes and ids are useful for styling, and can be used to target specific elements

    HTML/CSS Day Three:
        -Worked on positioning and borders
        -import is good for getting styles and css from outside in your current program
        -lorem ipsum is good to fill out content on your web pages to test layouts and other things
        -Also started working on selectors, which are used to target specific elements in your html
