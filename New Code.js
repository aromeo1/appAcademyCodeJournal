    Light Binary Trees and Traversal Notes:        
        -Binary Trees all have a root, and each node has at most two children (left child and right child)
        -each child node of the root is less then the root node on the left, and greater on the right
        -breath traversal will visit nodes in the order of the level of the tree
        -depth traversal will visit nodes in the order of the depth of the tree
        -need to have sorted Data before using a binary tree to search
